While doing this homework you will learn: <br> 1) how to pre-process the data <br> 2) perform model selection (which algorithm should you use for building your model, logistic regression or k-nearest neighbor?)  <br>3) perform hyperparameter selection (what value of K should you use in yourk-nearest neighbor algorithm) <br>After you selected the best model via cross validation, you will apply your model to the test set and report your performance to me."
